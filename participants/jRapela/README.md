Affiliation: [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)

Position: Research engineer fellow.

Moderator: [Bonsai.ML session](../../sessions/machineLearning)

## A few that I liked about the conference

- Communities and collaborations are of great importance in research, specially in Neuroscience. In this conference I discovered a unique community of Bonsai developers and users, composed of scientists, engineers and software developers. The excitement I felt in the conference was thrilling. Most importantly, I met a very nice, cordial and friendly people.

- Before the conference I already appreciated two revolutionary ideas behind Bonsai. First, the adoption of the reactive framework for Neuroscience experimental control. Second, creating a visual programming language for reactive programming languages. Graphical programming not only allows people with no programming experience to build sophisticated experiments, but also greatly augments the productivity of experienced programmers. Beyond this, the conference showed me a glimpse of the ambitious plans of the Bonsai Foundation for the future of Bonsai.

- Interactions in the conference helped us focus the Bonsai.ML development program, showed us how to better disseminate Bonsai.ML, and suggested us new promising application areas for it. We also built new collaborations with potential new users of Bonsai.ML. We better appreciated how useful could be Bonsai.ML for the Bonsai community. We are excited by the possibility to contribute a little to this community.

- I appreciated the wide variety of domains that Bonsai covers and better understood the magnitude of the Bonsai project.

## A few suggestions to improve the next conference

- A unique application area for Bonsai is close loop experimental control. Despite this, the conference did not featured any talk on this topic. For the next conference I would like to see talks on this topic, like a talk by Jacob White on close-loop control of neural activity in song birds, or a talk by Jork de Kok on close-loop control of behaviour in mice.
