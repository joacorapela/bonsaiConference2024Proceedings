Affiliation: [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)

Position: Research engineer fellow.

Moderator: [Bonsai.ML session](../../sessions/machineLearning)

## A few that I liked about the conference

- Communities and collaborations are of great importance in Neuroscience research. In this conference I discovered a wonderful community of Bonsai developers and users, composed of scientists, engineers and software developers. The excitement I felt in the conference was unique. Most importantly, I met a very nice, cordial and friendly group of human beings.

- Before the conference I already knew that Goncalo was a genius by recognising the potential of the reactive framework for Neuroscience experimental control, and by pioneering the use of graphical programming for reactive languages. Graphical programming not only allows people with no programming experience to build sophisticated experiments, but also greatly augments the productivity of experienced programmers. Beyond this, the conference showed me a glimpse of the generous plans of Goncalo and the Bonsai Foundation.

- Interactions in the conference helped me focus the Bonsai.ML development program, showed me how to better disseminate Bonsai.ML, and suggested me new promising application areas for it. I also built new collaborations with potential new users of Bonsai.ML. I understood that Bonsai.ML could be very helpful for the Bonsai community, and I am excited to contribute a little to it.

- I appreciated the wide variety of domains that Bonsai covers and better understood the magnitude of the Bonsai project.

- I learned about new exciting application domains of Bonsai.

## A few suggestions to improve the next conference

- A unique application area for Bonsai is close loop experimental control. Despite this, the conference did not featured any talk on this topic. For the next conference I would like to see talks on this topic, like a talk by Jacob White on close-loop control of neural activity in song birds, or a talk by Jork de Kok on close-loop control of behaviour in mice.
