## What I Liked About the Conference

* As a member of the community for several years, and author of [BonZeb](https://github.com/ncguilbeault/BonZeb), it was great to see the Bonsai community come together in person for the first time. It was nice to put faces to names finally, and connect with people who had helped me learn Bonsai over the years. It was also great to meet new people who used Bonsai and learn of their diverse interests.

* Everyone who attended was nice, respectful, and enthusiastic about Bonsai, which made the conference very enjoyable and a great networking opportunity. 

* I was very surprised by the numerous, diverse projects powered by Bonsai and I was impressed by all of the ways in which Bonsai integrates with and builds upon other technologies. I was also very impressed with the numerous advanced uses of Bonsai around task control, hardware, quantification, etc.

* It was great to get feedback and suggestions from the community about the Bonsai.ML project. I am excited by the possibility of collaborating with others and developing new applications which could enhance the Bonsai programming language and facilitate neuroscience research. It also gave me a new outlook on the future of Bonsai.ML and directions to explore in the future.

## Suggestions for the future

* It would have been nice to have a C#/reactive developer-focused session. As a developer, there are still many things about the language I don't fully understand, and I would have found it useful to dive more into the internals of Bonsai and the high-level architecture of the language.

* It would be great to have a more "hackathon-centric" event with the developer community
