## Abstract

Typically, neuroscientists use Bonsai for acquisition but rely on other
programming languages, such as Python and MATLAB, for offline processing with
machine learning (ML) algorithms. Recently, we started adding ML functionality
to Bonsai by developing packages that interface with powerful ML tools for
online data analysis. In this session we will discuss the basics of online
probabilistic machine learning, and introduce a new package Bonsai.ML which
aims at extending Bonsai with online machine learning techniques, such as
linear dynamical systems, hidden Markov models, online Bayesian linear
regression and neural decoding models. We will provide examples and tutorials
throughout the session and end with a discussion on the future of machine
learning in Bonsai.
